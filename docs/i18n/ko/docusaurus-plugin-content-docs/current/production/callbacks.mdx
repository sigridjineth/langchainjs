# Events / Callbacks

LangChain provides a callback system that allows you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. This is useful for logging, [monitoring](./tracing), [streaming](../modules/models/llms/additional_functionality#streaming-responses), and other tasks.

You can subscribe to these events by using the `callbacks` argument available throughout the API. This method accepts a list of handler objects, which are expected to implement one or more of the methods described in the [API docs](../api/callbacks/interfaces/CallbackHandlerMethods).

## Using an existing handler

LangChain provides a few built-in handlers that you can use to get started. These are available in the `langchain/callbacks` module. The most basic handler is the `ConsoleCallbackHandler`, which simply logs all events to the console. In the future we will add more default handlers to the library. Note that when the `verbose` flag on the object is set to `true`, the `ConsoleCallbackHandler` will be invoked even without being explicitly passed in.

import ConsoleExample from "@examples/callbacks/console_handler.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ConsoleExample}</CodeBlock>

## Creating a one-off handler

You can create a one-off handler inline by passing a plain object to the `callbacks` argument. This object should implement the [`CallbackHandlerMethods`](../api/callbacks/interfaces/CallbackHandlerMethods) interface. This is useful if eg. you need to create a handler that you will use only for a single request, eg to stream the output of an LLM/Agent/etc to a websocket.

import StreamingExample from "@examples/models/llm/llm_streaming.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamingExample}</CodeBlock>

## Using multiple handlers

We offer a method on the `CallbackManager` class that allows you to create a one-off handler. This is useful if eg. you need to create a handler that you will use only for a single request, eg to stream the output of an LLM/Agent/etc to a websocket.

This is a more complete example that passes a `CallbackManager` to a ChatModel, and LLMChain, a Tool, and an Agent.

import AgentExample from "@examples/agents/streaming.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AgentExample}</CodeBlock>

## Creating a custom handler

You can also create your own handler by implementing the `CallbackHandler` interface. This is useful if you want to do something more complex than just logging to the console, eg. send the events to a logging service. As an example here is the implementation of the `ConsoleCallbackHandler`:

```typescript
import { BaseCallbackHandler } from "langchain/callbacks";

export class MyCallbackHandler extends BaseCallbackHandler {
  async handleChainStart(chain: { name: string }) {
    console.log(`Entering new ${chain.name} chain...`);
  }

  async handleChainEnd(_output: ChainValues) {
    console.log("Finished chain.");
  }

  async handleAgentAction(action: AgentAction) {
    console.log(action.log);
  }

  async handleToolEnd(output: string) {
    console.log(output);
  }

  async handleText(text: string) {
    console.log(text);
  }

  async handleAgentEnd(action: AgentFinish) {
    console.log(action.log);
  }
}
```

You could then use it as described in the [section](#using-an-existing-handler) above.
